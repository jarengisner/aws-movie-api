# Movie Findr API

Movie Findr API is an API created for future projects to interact with a MongoDB database. The API grants access to a select few movies that are going to be used for future React and Angular front-end projects.

The API provides user interactions, such as creating a username and password, storing some account information, and storing a list of the users favorite movies from the database. The API also provides the ability to fetch movies, along with the movies details, genre and director. Detailed information about the director and genre is also accessible through the API.

This is a REST API which provides methods to read, write, update, and delete information from the MongoDB database which it is connected to.
